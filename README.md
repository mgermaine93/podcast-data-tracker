# Podcast Data Tracker

Playing around with Assembly AI's API and transcription capabilities. Basic goals include breaking individual podcast episodes down by speakers and their respective speaking times and identifying what proportions of each podcast are given to advertising/promotions.

Advanced goals include presenting data for several podcasts at once (stacked bar charts, etc.), perhaps adding some interactive components as well.
